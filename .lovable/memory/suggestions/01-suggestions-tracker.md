# Suggestions Tracker

## Last Updated: 2026-03-29T16:00:00+08:00

## Convention

- **Location**: `.lovable/memory/suggestions/` — this file for active tracking, `completed/` for archives.
- **File naming**: Single tracker file (`01-suggestions-tracker.md`). Individual completed suggestions archived in `completed/NN-slug.md`.
- **Statuses**: `open` → `inProgress` → `done`
- **Completion handling**: When done, update status here. Optionally create detail file in `completed/`.
- **Suggestion file content** (when creating individual files):
  - suggestionId, createdAt, source, affectedProject, description, rationale, proposed change, acceptance criteria, status, completion notes

## Active Suggestions

### S-009: Deprecated API Cleanup
- **suggestionId**: S-009
- **createdAt**: 2026-03-21
- **source**: Lovable (codebase audit)
- **affectedProject**: core
- **description**: Remove or sunset 110 deprecated functions/methods across 30+ files. Largest concentrations: `coreindexes/indexes.go` (21), `core.go` (13), `coredata/corestr/` (15+), `coredata/corejson/` (6+), `coredata/stringslice/` (5+).
- **rationale**: Deprecated functions add API surface confusion and maintenance cost. Generic replacements already exist.
- **proposed change**: Phase approach — (1) audit all 110 deprecated markers, (2) confirm generic replacements exist, (3) remove in batches with compile verification.
- **acceptance criteria**: Zero `// Deprecated:` markers remain (or only those with documented external consumers). `./run.ps1 PC` and `TC` pass.
- **status**: open
- **dependencies**: External consumer audit (user must grep across auk-go repos)

### S-010: Performance Benchmarks
- **suggestionId**: S-010
- **createdAt**: 2026-03-21
- **source**: Lovable (codebase audit)
- **affectedProject**: core
- **description**: Add `Benchmark*` tests for hot-path operations. Currently zero benchmarks exist. Priority targets: `coredata/corestr/Collection` (Add, Get, Join), `coredata/coredynamic` (type casting), `errcore` (error construction with stack traces), `codestack` (trace capture), `regexnew` (lazy compile), `mutexbykey` (lock contention).
- **rationale**: No performance baseline exists. Regressions are invisible without benchmarks.
- **proposed change**: Create `*_bench_test.go` files in priority packages. Include `b.ReportAllocs()`.
- **acceptance criteria**: ≥30 benchmarks across 6+ packages. Results documented in benchmark summary.
- **status**: open
- **dependencies**: None
- **completion notes**: —

### S-012: Pointer Receiver Audit
- **suggestionId**: S-012
- **createdAt**: 2026-03-21
- **source**: Lovable (codebase audit)
- **affectedProject**: core
- **description**: 5,224 pointer receivers vs 2,836 value receivers. Many small readonly methods (getters, checkers, formatters) on immutable types likely use pointer receivers unnecessarily.
- **rationale**: Value receivers are idiomatic for small, read-only types. They enable better compiler optimizations and prevent nil-receiver panics.
- **proposed change**: Audit top packages (`coredata/corestr`, `errcore`, `coredata/corepayload`) for methods that could safely use value receivers.
- **acceptance criteria**: Identified methods migrated without behavior changes. `./run.ps1 TC` passes.
- **status**: open
- **dependencies**: None (but be careful of types with caching fields — pointer receivers required)
- **completion notes**: —

### S-013: Sync.Mutex → sync.RWMutex Audit
- **suggestionId**: S-013
- **createdAt**: 2026-03-21
- **source**: Lovable (codebase audit)
- **affectedProject**: core
- **description**: 27 `sync.Mutex` usages found. Read-heavy collection types (Collection, Hashmap, Hashset) may benefit from `sync.RWMutex` for concurrent read performance.
- **rationale**: `RWMutex` allows multiple concurrent readers, improving throughput for read-heavy workloads.
- **proposed change**: Audit each mutex usage. Migrate to `RWMutex` where read methods (Get, Contains, Len, IsEmpty) dominate.
- **acceptance criteria**: Identified candidates migrated. Benchmark showing improvement for read-heavy scenarios.
- **status**: open (depends on S-010 for benchmarks)
- **dependencies**: S-010 (benchmarks needed to measure improvement)
- **completion notes**: —

### S-014: Coverage Push — Remaining Packages
- **suggestionId**: S-014
- **createdAt**: 2026-03-21
- **source**: Lovable (carried from prior coverage work)
- **affectedProject**: core
- **description**: Continue coverage push for packages below 100%. Key targets: `corestr` (3.3%), `coredynamic` (0.9%), `corejson` (45%), `corepayload` (56%), `corecmp` (10.8%), `codestack` (0%).
- **rationale**: Coverage gaps hide bugs, especially in high-risk packages.
- **proposed change**: Run TC → identify gaps → one package at a time → compile gate.
- **acceptance criteria**: All packages at 100% coverage (excluding dead-code registry entries).
- **status**: open
- **dependencies**: User must run `./run.ps1 TC` for current baseline
- **completion notes**: —

### S-015: Version Bump Discipline
- **suggestionId**: S-015
- **createdAt**: 2026-03-29
- **source**: User instruction
- **affectedProject**: core
- **description**: Any code change must bump at least the minor version everywhere except the `.release` folder which must never be modified.
- **rationale**: User requirement for version tracking discipline.
- **proposed change**: Enforce version bump check on every code modification session.
- **acceptance criteria**: Every code-changing session includes a version bump. `.release` folder never touched.
- **status**: open (permanent process rule)
- **dependencies**: None
- **completion notes**: —
